========
Here is the initial planning of the game I intend to build:

its genre (from the assignment page or one you have made up):
  Role-playing game
  
its consumer tempting, ear popping, name (and the back story, or epic challenge, if you want)
  Duke-mon (Duke-Monsters), as a sister game of nowadays popular game on Nintendo platform, pocket monster. The back end story is that I have always wanted to creat some game that have real world based-map, and has a role-playing feature built into it. 
  
its goal (how to win the game or advance levels)
  You and your friends are going to walk around Duke campus, and there are different challenge in different location you hit. To win the game, you have to survive each challenge/fight proposed at particular locations, and to advance level, you have to clear one goal after another. 
  
its basic mechanics (how to play the game)
  As mentioned previously, you and your friends will be walking on the Duke map, and you can buy goods. Once you have hit a particular locations, you will eb lead into a series of challenges -- series of fights in role-playing fasion (like the Final Fantasy Demo Video). Once you finished the challenge at particular location, you are guided back to map, and continues to explore the Duke Campus map.
  
what is different about its levels or modes
  Modes: Combat mode, and walk-around mode
  Levels: Normal challenge level and boss challenge level. The difference will be that in boss-challenge level, the boss will be bigger, stronger, and smarter
